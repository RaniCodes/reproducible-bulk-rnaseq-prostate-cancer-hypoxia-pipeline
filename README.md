# Reproducible bulk RNA‑seq pipeline for prostate cancer hypoxia

End‑to‑end workflow for LNCaP and PC3 cell lines (hypoxia vs normoxia):
FASTQ QC → HISAT2 alignment → featureCounts → DESeq2, with documented
installation, decisions, and troubleshooting on an 8‑GB laptop.

> Status: This repository is under active development. The core workflow is
> implemented; documentation and examples are being expanded.
